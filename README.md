# Education-and-Resources
This repository is born to join all the notes, lessons and the resources I've been producing in my University journey. 
These notes aren't just a perfect copy of what the professors said in their courses. 
These notes are the result of active rielaboration and deepening that i liked to conduct for the pure joy of learning new things.  
Unfortunately, the majority of these notes are in italian, my mother toungue, but there are also resources written in english.
